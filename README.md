Co-evolution Utilities
======================
The co-evolution utilities software suite is designed to compare the sites of evolutionary constraint in various subfamilies of a larger protein family.  It supports both conservation-based and co-evolutionary sequence analyses.  Conserved positions are individual sites that retain the same choice of amino acid throughout evolution.  Co-evolving positions are pairs of sites that mutate in a coordinated manner throughout evolution.

The software provides support for:

* Differential conservation analysis
* Automated co-evolutionary analysis using an ensemble average approach
* Comparison between co-evolution networks of homologous proteins
* Centrality analysis of co-evolutionary networks

The suite was used as part of Parente and Swint-Kruse (2013).  Multiple Co-Evolutionary Networks Are Supported by the Common Tertiary Scaffold of the LacI/GalR Proteins.  PLoS ONE.  http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0084398
